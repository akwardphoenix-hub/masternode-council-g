# Masternode Council - Governance & Decision Management System

A decentralized governance platform for managing proposals, voting mechanisms, and maintaining transparent audit trails across distributed nodes.

**Experience Qualities:**
1. **Authoritative** - Instills confidence through clear hierarchy and structured decision-making processes
2. **Transparent** - Every action is logged and visible, building trust through complete visibility  
3. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflows that don't impede the decision-making process

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Handles proposal submission, voting, and audit logging with persistent state management

## Essential Features

**Proposal Management**
- Functionality: Submit, view, and track governance proposals with detailed descriptions
- Purpose: Enable structured decision-making and change management
- Trigger: Council members submit proposals for system changes or improvements
- Progression: Submit proposal → Review by council → Voting phase → Resolution → Audit log
- Success criteria: Proposals are clearly tracked from submission to resolution

**Voting System**  
- Functionality: Cast votes (approve, reject, abstain) on active proposals
- Purpose: Democratic consensus building among council nodes
- Trigger: Active proposal enters voting phase
- Progression: View proposal → Cast vote → See vote tally → Await resolution
- Success criteria: All votes are recorded and contribute to proposal outcomes

**Audit Trail**
- Functionality: Immutable log of all council actions and decisions
- Purpose: Maintain transparency and accountability in governance
- Trigger: Any council action (proposal, vote, resolution)
- Progression: Action occurs → Log entry created → Timestamp recorded → Public visibility
- Success criteria: Complete history of all governance activities is preserved

**Council Dashboard**
- Functionality: Overview of active proposals, recent votes, and system status
- Purpose: Centralized command center for council operations
- Trigger: Council member accesses the system
- Progression: Login → Dashboard view → Navigate to specific functions → Take actions
- Success criteria: Clear visibility into all council activities and pending items

## Edge Case Handling

- **Duplicate Proposals**: Prevention through title checking and similarity detection
- **Invalid Votes**: Validation ensures only authorized nodes can vote once per proposal
- **Concurrent Actions**: Race condition handling for simultaneous proposal submissions
- **Data Corruption**: Backup mechanisms and validation for critical governance data
- **Network Partitions**: Graceful handling when nodes are temporarily disconnected

## Design Direction

The design should evoke trust, authority, and technological sophistication - like a digital courthouse meets mission control. Minimal interface with rich functionality, emphasizing clarity over decoration to serve the critical nature of governance decisions.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using deep purples, golds, and teals to convey authority, wisdom, and technological advancement.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Purple (`oklch(0.25 0.15 270)`) - Communicates authority and governance
- **Secondary Colors**: Rich Gold (`oklch(0.7 0.12 85)`) for emphasis and Teal (`oklch(0.6 0.15 180)`) for active states  
- **Accent Color**: Bright Gold (`oklch(0.8 0.18 75)`) - Commands attention for critical actions and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White `oklch(1 0 0)`): Dark Purple text (`oklch(0.2 0.1 270)`) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray `oklch(0.98 0 0)`): Dark Purple text (`oklch(0.2 0.1 270)`) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Purple `oklch(0.25 0.15 270)`): White text (`oklch(1 0 0)`) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey institutional authority while remaining highly readable for technical content - using Inter for its clarity in governance interfaces.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/compact spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that reinforce the gravity of governance decisions while providing clear feedback for user actions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates the weight of decisions and guides attention to critical actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Proposal submissions and vote casting receive primary animation focus, with subtle transitions for navigation

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Cards for proposals, Badges for status, Buttons for actions, Tables for vote tracking, Timeline for audit logs
- **Customizations**: Custom vote buttons with distinct states, proposal status indicators, specialized audit log timeline
- **States**: Hover states emphasize interactivity, active states show current selections, disabled states prevent invalid actions
- **Icon Selection**: Scale/Balance for governance, Check/X for votes, Clock for pending, Eye for audit trail
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit spacing scale (16px, 24px, 32px) for clear visual hierarchy
- **Mobile**: Responsive cards stack vertically, vote buttons remain thumb-friendly, critical actions stay above fold
