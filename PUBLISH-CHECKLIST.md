## Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **Create Release Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Update Version**
   ```bash
   npm version patch  # or minor, major
   ```

3. **Update CHANGELOG**
   - Document all changes
   - Include breaking changes
   - Credit contributors

4. **Final Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run test:e2e
   ./scripts/pre-publish-check.sh
   ```

5. **Commit and Tag**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git tag v1.0.0
   ```

6. **Merge to Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.0.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

## Post-Deployment Steps

- [ ] Verify deployment is live
- [ ] Smoke test production environment
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Check analytics for any issues
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of successful deployment
- [ ] Update documentation with any new links
- [ ] Archive release branch
- [ ] Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Emergency Rollback

If critical issues are found:

1. **Immediate Action**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   git checkout v0.9.9
   # Deploy previous version
   ```

2. **Document Issue**
   - What went wrong
   - Impact assessment
   - Root cause
   - Prevention plan

3. **Fix and Redeploy**
   - Create hotfix branch
   - Fix the issue
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy again

## Quick Reference

### Run All Validations

```bash
# Automated validation
./scripts/pre-publish-check.sh

# Manual testing
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test in browser
npm run test:e2e
```

### Common Issues

**Build fails**
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Check dependencies: `npm install`

**Tests fail**
- Run in UI mode: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- Check logs: `playwright-report/`

**Performance issues**
- Check bundle size: `ls -lh dist/assets/`
- Analyze build: `npm run build -- --mode production`

## Notes

- This checklist should be updated as new requirements emerge
- Not all items may apply to every release
- Use judgment to determine what's critical for your deployment
- Document any deviations from this checklist

**Remember**: It's better to delay a release than to deploy broken code to production. Take your time and be thorough! âœ…
