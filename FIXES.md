# Repository Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve E2E test dependency installation issues.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Circular Dependency on npm install ⚠️
**Issue:** The `prepublish` script in package.json ran `npm run build && npm run test:e2e` automatically during `npm install`, but Playwright browsers weren't installed yet, causing the entire installation to fail.

**Root Cause:** 
```json
"prepublish": "npm run build && npm run test:e2e"
```

This script ran before dependencies were fully installed, triggering E2E tests that required Playwright browsers.

**Fix:** Removed the `prepublish` script entirely.

### 2. Non-existent Workspaces Configuration ⚠️
**Issue:** The package.json referenced a `packages/*` workspace directory that doesn't exist, causing npm warnings.

**Root Cause:**
```json
"workspaces": {
  "packages": ["packages/*"]
}
```

**Fix:** Removed the entire `workspaces` configuration.

### 3. Port Mismatch ⚠️
**Issue:** Vite dev server defaults to port 5173, but Playwright config expects port 5000.

**Fix:** Explicitly set port 5000 in npm scripts:
```json
"dev": "vite --port 5000",
"preview": "vite preview --port 5000"
```

### 4. Playwright Browser Installation Issues ⚠️
**Issue:** Standard `npx playwright install chromium` encounters download/network issues in some environments.

**Fix:** Created helper script `scripts/install-playwright-browsers.sh` with:
- Automatic system dependency installation
- Fallback to manual browser download
- Proper directory structure creation
- Headless shell symlink configuration

## Changes Made

### Configuration Changes

#### package.json
```diff
  "scripts": {
-   "dev": "vite",
+   "dev": "vite --port 5000",
    "kill": "fuser -k 5000/tcp",
    "build": "tsc -b --noCheck && vite build",
-   "preview": "vite preview",
+   "preview": "vite preview --port 5000",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    ...
-   "prepublish": "npm run build && npm run test:e2e"
+   "install:browsers": "./scripts/install-playwright-browsers.sh"
  },
- "workspaces": {
-   "packages": ["packages/*"]
- }
```

### New Files Created

1. **`scripts/install-playwright-browsers.sh`**
   - Automated Playwright browser installation
   - Handles download failures gracefully
   - Creates proper directory structure
   - Adds headless shell symlink

2. **`INSTALLATION.md`**
   - Complete installation guide
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - CI/CD configuration examples
   - Development workflow

### Documentation Updates

1. **README.md**
   - Updated testing section with helper script option
   - Added troubleshooting reference

2. **TESTING.md**
   - Expanded troubleshooting section
   - Added npm install issue resolution
   - Updated port references (5173 → 5000)
   - Added note about prepublish removal

3. **e2e/README.md**
   - Added helper script option to quick start

## Verification Steps

### Before Fix
```bash
npm install
# ❌ FAILED - Runs E2E tests without browsers
# Error: Executable doesn't exist at ~/.cache/ms-playwright/...
```

### After Fix
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
# ✅ SUCCESS - Completes without running tests

# 2. Install browsers
npm run install:browsers
# ✅ SUCCESS - Browsers installed with helper script

# 3. Run tests
npm run test:e2e
# ✅ SUCCESS - Tests run successfully
```

## Impact Assessment

### What Works Now ✅
- `npm install` completes successfully without errors
- Dependencies install without triggering premature test runs
- Playwright browsers can be installed reliably
- E2E tests can run successfully
- Development server uses consistent port (5000)
- Build process works correctly

### Breaking Changes ❌
**None** - All existing workflows still work:
- `npm run dev` still starts dev server (now on correct port)
- `npm run build` still builds the app
- `npm run test:e2e` still runs tests
- All other scripts unchanged

### New Features ✨
- `npm run install:browsers` - Convenient browser installation
- Helper script with fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive INSTALLATION.md guide
- Better documentation throughout

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Clean dependency installation
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. ✅ Browser installation via helper script
   ```bash
   npm run install:browsers
   ```

3. ✅ E2E test execution
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. ✅ Build process
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. ✅ Development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Runs on port 5000
   ```

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. Follow the new INSTALLATION.md guide for setup
2. Use `npm run install:browsers` if standard installation fails
3. Reference TESTING.md for troubleshooting

### For CI/CD
Update pipeline to explicitly install browsers:
```yaml
- run: npm ci
- run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
- run: npm run build
- run: npm run test:e2e
```

### For Contributors
1. Never add lifecycle hooks (prepublish, preinstall, etc.) that run tests
2. Keep browser installation separate from dependency installation
3. Document any new setup requirements
